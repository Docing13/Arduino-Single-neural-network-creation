This project is using for simple neural network creation and uploading it to arduino.

1. Use the reader.py script to collect data from arduino and write it into a txt file.
2. Use the simpler_keras_arduino.py to generate and train your own model, this script
will create files with weights and biases.
3. Copy weights and biases from files into the nn.ino, customize model properties.
4. Upload
